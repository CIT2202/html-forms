# HTML Forms
The aim of this practical is to give you some practice with HTML forms (no PHP).
* Open the file *html-forms.html*.
* This contains content that you need to make into an HTML form.
* The final form needs to be made up of three text fields, a group of radio buttons, a checkbox and a submit button. If you look at the text in the HTML page you should be able to work out which form controls should be used and where.
* Make sure you use ```<label>``` elements, ```id``` attributes, ```name``` attributes, and ```value``` attributes where appropriate.
* You may need to add some ```<div>``` elements around the form controls to help control the layout of the page.
* Optionally you could add some CSS to style the form controls.
* Use these [notes](https://github.com/CIT2202/html-forms/blob/master/html-forms.md) or other suitable resource e.g. https://developer.mozilla.org/ to help you build the form.
